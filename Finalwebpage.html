            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Claire Angelic B. Sarto</strong>, and I am 24 years old. I was born and raised on the beautiful <strong>Ticao Island</strong> in Lagundi, Masbate. Growing up surrounded by the ocean, my childhood was filled with the sounds of waves, splashing water, and running barefoot under the coconut trees. It was a simple life, one that I will never exchange for anything.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="family">
            <h2>My Family Story</h2>
            <p>When I was a kid, my mother worked abroad as an OFW and provided for our family, which made me closer to my father. Being apart from my mother had a big impact on me, especially as the second child and a girl. My father did his best to fill in all the gaps and taught me many things about life.</p>

            <p>I studied in Ticao Island until Grade 3, and then I transferred to the city. That was when I realized how hard life could be. My family didn’t have a permanent home, so my siblings and I moved between our aunts’ houses to sleep and eat. My father worked as a truck driver for a food company to support us.</p>

            <p>When I reached high school, my parents decided that it was my father’s turn to work abroad. At first, it felt strange having my mom around because we weren’t used to it, but after a month, we got used to her presence. I became happy having her around — finally, I had someone to talk to about “girl things.” I was also amazed by her cooking skills that she learned from working overseas.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="present">
            <h2>My Present Journey</h2>
            <p>Now, I am studying in <strong>Legazpi City</strong> as a 3rd-year college student at the <strong>University of Santo Tomas-Legazpi</strong>, majoring in <strong>Financial Management</strong>. I chose this course because growing up, I witnessed firsthand that managing money is the key to survival.</p>

            <p>Living independently now feels natural because my parents prepared me for it, my father taught me how to survive in this harsh world, while my mother taught me how to live, cook, and take care of myself and others. Their lessons continue to guide me as I pursue my dreams.</p>

            <h2></strong>My Dream in Life</h2>
            <p>When I was a kid, I always dreamt of becoming a <strong>Flight Attendant</strong>. I looked up to them and admired how they could witness the hellos and goodbyes of families and friends. For me, it was such a beautiful moment, one that shows love, hope, and connection in people’s lives.</p>

            <p>But as I grew older and faced the realities of being a young adult, my dream slowly changed. Today, my biggest dream is to become <strong>successful</strong>, not only for myself, but for my family. I want to <strong>retire my parents</strong>, pay off all our debts, and help them start a small business. I want to go back to the island where I grew up and live a peaceful life, far from the chaos of the city.</p>

            <p>For me, success is not about luxury or fame, it’s about <strong>freedom, family, and peace</strong>. I want to give back to the people who sacrificed so much for me and return to the simple life that shaped who I am today.</p>
